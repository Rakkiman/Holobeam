The killer is of unnatural origin, likely caused by experiments of late A. Hunt and the Heavens Society. Taskforce G has tracked them since Ridgeway murders and Groversville Flu. Need more intel on both, something is amiss. Your team consists of Goliath and Grace. Goliath: USAMRIID, knows hypergeometry, smart, efficient, in too deep soon. Grace: DEA, effective at disposal, egoistic, pedantic, at risk of exposure.   More information at GB, 34°43'28.5''N 113°48'00.8''W. From there, proceed to the scene with caution. Adam."
